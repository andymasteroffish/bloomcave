#Bloom Cave

Bloom Cave is an endless cave-gardening sim created by Andy Wallace in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2016 for the theme “ritual.”

The game was created in Unity with all graphics done in Photoshop using the Pico-8 color palette.

The music is an original composition by Nathaniel Chambers.
Sound effects were created using Bfxr.

You are free to peruse the code, but be aware that it was written hastily and had 0 bug checking.
